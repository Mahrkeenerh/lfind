# LFind Project Goals

## Overview
LFind is a natural language file search tool designed for straightforward file discovery. Users enter plain text queries—similar to searching on Google—and receive a ranked list of matching files from their repository. The tool combines basic metadata filtering with semantic associations to deliver relevant results effortlessly.

## Core Goals
- **Intuitive Search:** Enable users to find files using natural language queries without specialized command syntax.
- **Efficient Filtering:** Leverage file metadata (such as type, extension, and size) to narrow results quickly.
- **Semantic Relevance:** Apply vector-based similarity techniques to rank files by relevance.
- **Lightweight & Accessible:** Maintain low resource usage with a simple installation process.
- **Privacy-Centric:** Support offline operation with local models to protect user data.

## Features and Capabilities
- **Natural Language Query Input:** Users simply enter a search query in plain language.
- **Metadata Filtering:** Quickly limit results based on inherent file attributes.
- **Semantic Matching:** Utilize embedding techniques to assess file content relevance.
- **Simple Interface:** Provide a search experience akin to modern web search engines.
- **Future Expansion:** Lay the groundwork for enhancements into an LLM-powered communication tool.

## Usage
For now, LFind demonstrates its core functionalities through direct Python interaction. Import the relevant modules in your Python environment to perform natural language file searches, leverage metadata filtering, and execute semantic matching on your repository. Future iterations will introduce a dedicated CLI interface and an LLM-driven approach to handle all interactions.
