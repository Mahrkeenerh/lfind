# LFind Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap focuses on the core functionality with an emphasis on modularity and incremental development. Configuration files and comprehensive user interface components are deferred until later stages.

---

## 1. File System Scanning & Metadata Extraction
- **Module Goals:**  
  - Walk through the directory tree.  
  - Extract file metadata (name, path, type, size, creation/modification dates).  
- **Steps:**  
  - Implement a file scanner that respects ignore patterns.  
  - Develop metadata extraction utilities.  
  - Incorporate basic error handling for inaccessible files.

---

## 2. Metadata Database Management (SQLite)
- **Module Goals:**  
  - Store and update the extracted file metadata.  
  - Provide essential CRUD operations for file records.  
- **Steps:**  
  - Design a normalized schema for file metadata.  
  - Implement database connection, table creation, and update functions.  
  - Develop functions for marking records as "seen" and deleting outdated entries.

---

## 3. Embedding Generation & Vector Indexing
- **Module Goals:**  
  - Generate vector embeddings for file contents or titles.  
  - Use FAISS to build and query a vector search index.  
- **Steps:**  
  - Define an embedding model interface for abstraction.  
  - Implement one or more backends (e.g., SentenceTransformers, OpenAI).  
  - Create a FAISS manager to add, search, save, and load embeddings.  
  - Normalize vectors to support cosine similarity search.

---

## 4. LLM Integration
- **Module Goals:**  
  - Provide semantic query processing.  
  - Generate prompts and interpret responses from LLM services.  
- **Steps:**  
  - Develop an LLM client that wraps API calls.  
  - Design prompt templates for translating natural language queries.  
  - Incorporate fallback logic in the event the LLM service is unavailable.

---

## 5. Search Pipeline Integration
- **Module Goals:**  
  - Combine metadata filtering with semantic (vector-based and LLM-assisted) search routines.  
- **Steps:**  
  - Apply metadata filters to narrow down the list of candidate files.  
  - Execute semantic search using generated embeddings on the filtered set.  
  - Optionally apply LLM postâ€‘processing to refine and rank search results.

---

## 6. User Interface (Open End)
- **Note:**  
  - Detailed design of a dedicated CLI or GUI is deferred.  
  - Future iterations will integrate the core modules with a user-friendly interface for natural language search interactions.
