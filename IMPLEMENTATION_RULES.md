# Implementation Rules for LFind

This document defines the guidelines for our step-by-step, modular implementation of LFind. By following these rules, we ensure that each component is independently verifiable and that the overall system can be built incrementally.

## 1. Modularity is Key
- **Independent Components:** Each module should be developed as an independent component with a clear interface.
- **Loose Coupling:** Avoid unnecessary dependencies between modules. Communication should happen through well-defined APIs or data contracts.
- **Self-Containment:** Ensure that a module can be tested or verified on its own.

## 2. Step-by-Step Integration
- **Isolated Development:** Implement and test each module in isolation.
- **Incremental Integration:** Once a component is verified to work, integrate it with the existing system.
- **Verification After Implementation:** Write and run tests after implementing each module to confirm functionality.

## 3. Clear API Definitions
- **Interface Contracts:** Clearly define module interfaces so changes in one do not disrupt others.
- **Documentation:** Document each moduleâ€™s API and usage with brief examples.

## 4. Incremental Development Process
- **Planning:** Before coding a module, outline its purpose, interface, and expected behavior.
- **Prototyping:** Build a minimal version, verify its operation, then refine.
- **Review and Refactor:** Continuously review code and refactor as needed without enforcing formal peer reviews.

## 5. Simplified Testing and Error Handling
- **Verification Post-Implementation:** Write tests and perform manual verification after modules are developed.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error messages; advanced logging and fallback mechanisms are not required at this stage.

## 6. Configuration and Maintainability
- **Configuration:** Keep configuration simple. Use straightforward configuration files or environment variables only if essential.
- **Self-Documenting Code:** Code should be clear and commented where necessary for future maintenance.
- **Changelog:** Maintain brief notes on decisions or major changes during implementation.

By following these updated guidelines, we can build LFind step by step, ensuring each component works properly before moving on to the next.
